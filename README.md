# DeepFake_Detection_Videos
Detecting deepfake in videos using two methods and with the help of some research papers, to provide accuracy that was not previously present in detecting deepfake.

***********************
Code for Video Deepfake Detection model from "Combining EfficientNet and Vision Transformers for Video Deepfake Detection", Using this repository it is possible to train and test the two main architectures presented in the paper, Efficient Vision Transformers and Cross Efficient Vision Transformers, for video deepfake detection. The architectures exploits internally the EfficientNet-Pytorch and ViT-Pytorch repositories.
